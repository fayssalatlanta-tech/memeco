## 2026-05-24 — Constant-time webhook auth, pinned dependencies, GitHub Actions CI

### Why

Three pre-production items that were previously listed as follow-ups but
overdue for a 14k-LOC trading-adjacent codebase:

1. **`/api/whale-signal` is publicly reachable.** The auth check used a
   plain `==` comparison against `WHALE_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER`. Even with a
   long random secret this leaks the secret a byte at a time through
   response-time differences. Use `hmac.compare_digest(...)` so an
   attacker can't time-attack the secret.
2. **Unpinned dependencies.** `requirements.txt` had loose `>=` ranges
   and `pyproject.toml` mirrored them. A breaking `httpx` or `fastapi`
   release could silently break ingestion or the dashboard with no
   warning at install time.
3. **No CI.** Nothing was running tests, linting, or type-checking on
   pull requests. Easy to land a typo or import regression.

### What changed

#### `app/web_server.py`

- New `_whale_webhook_auth_ok(provided, expected)` helper. Encodes both
  inputs to UTF-8 bytes and compares them with `hmac.compare_digest`. If
  no expected secret is configured, auth is disabled (existing behavior).
- `api_whale_signal` calls the helper instead of using `!=` directly.
- Pulled the `from datetime import datetime, timezone` out of the body
  of `utc_now_iso()` to the top of the module (ruff PLC0415).
- Annotated `SCAN_STATE` and a couple of mixed `params` lists as
  `dict[str, Any]` / `list[Any]` so mypy is happy.

#### `app/services/watchlist_decision_service.py`

- Collapsed `liquidity_status == "LIQUIDITY_WEAK" or liquidity_status == "LIQUIDITY_WARNING"`
  into `liquidity_status in {"LIQUIDITY_WEAK", "LIQUIDITY_WARNING"}` (ruff PLR1714).

#### `app/services/whale_discovery_service.py`

- Removed an unused `native_received` local in `trade_from_wallet_row()`
  (ruff F841).

#### `app/apply_migrations.py`

- Renamed unused loop variable `version` → `_version` in the dry-run
  print loop (ruff B007).

#### `app/ingest_dexscreener.py`

- Added `from typing import Any` and an explicit
  `best_pair: dict[str, Any] | None` annotation so mypy can narrow the
  `if/else` correctly.

#### Mass auto-fixes (ruff `--fix`)

- 50 cosmetic fixes: import ordering (I001 × 30), trailing newlines
  (W292 × 8), unused imports (F401 × 6), trailing whitespace (W291/W293
  × 4), unused quoted annotations (UP037 × 2). No behavioral change.

#### `pyproject.toml`

- **Pinned all runtime deps to exact versions** (asyncpg 0.31.0,
  fastapi 0.136.3, httpx 0.28.1, python-dotenv 1.2.2, tenacity 9.1.4,
  uvicorn[standard] 0.48.0). These are the versions used in current
  testing.
- Added `[project.optional-dependencies] dev = [ruff, mypy, types-...]`.
  Install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- Added `[tool.ruff]` config: line-length 100, target Python 3.10, and
  a focused rule selection (E/W/F/I/B/UP/PL/RUF). Ignored a handful of
  pylint metrics that don't fit a service-heavy codebase
  (PLR0911-15 too-many-X, PLR2004 magic numbers, B008 fastapi default,
  PLW0603 SCAN_STATE global).
- Added `[tool.mypy]` config: lenient (no implicit optional + strict
  equality + warn unused ignores), with `app.services.*` overridden to
  ignore-errors because those modules are dominated by raw upstream
  JSON shapes that don't pay back the typing cost. `tests/` is excluded
  from mypy entirely; tests run under unittest.

#### `requirements.txt`

- Pinned to the same versions as `pyproject.toml`. The file remains as
  a back-compat alias; the canonical list is `pyproject.toml`.

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new)

- Two jobs:
  1. **`lint-and-types`** runs `ruff check .` and `mypy` on Python 3.12.
  2. **`unit-tests`** runs `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`
     against Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 in parallel
     (`fail-fast: false`).
- pip is cached against `pyproject.toml` + `requirements.txt`.
- Concurrency group cancels superseded runs on the same branch.
- `permissions: contents: read` is the minimum needed for checkout.

#### `tests/test_webhook_auth.py` (new)

- Six tests pin the `_whale_webhook_auth_ok` helper:
  empty/missing config = auth disabled; missing provided header = reject;
  matching secret = accept; wrong secret = reject; off-by-one prefix and
  off-by-one suffix = reject; non-ASCII secret round-trips correctly.

### Backwards compatibility

- The `/api/whale-signal` route's _functional_ behavior is unchanged: a
  configured secret still requires a matching `Authorization` header,
  and a missing/wrong header still returns 401. Only the comparison
  primitive changed.
- All public API responses, CLI commands, and database schema are
  untouched.
- Pinning runtime deps to exact versions means `pip install -e .` will
  resolve to the tested set, but anyone who depended on a wider range
  may need to upgrade pip / use a fresh venv. This is the intended
  behavior — silent dep drift was the bug we're fixing.

### Tests

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — **72 tests**, all green
  (66 existing + 6 new auth helper tests).
- `ruff check .` — All checks passed.
- `mypy` — Success: no issues found in 50 source files.
- All three commands are wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, so
  future PRs are blocked on the same gates.

### Follow-ups identified during this work (NOT addressed here)

- `mypy` is lenient by design. Tightening `app.services.*` (currently
  `ignore_errors = true`) would catch a few real bugs but requires a
  big typing pass on the upstream-JSON code paths.
- The CI doesn't run a real Postgres yet, so SQL changes are still
  validated only by manual scan + the unit-test fakes. A Postgres /
  TimescaleDB service container per `unit-tests` job would close that
  gap and let `tests/` reach the real `risk_checks` insert path.
- `docker-compose.yml` still has `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_strong_password`
  hard-coded (FastAPI changelog follow-up #2). Out of scope for this
  PR; should switch to `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?...}` and `.env` next.

## 2026-05-24 — Retries with backoff, Helius rate limit, batched risk_check inserts

### Why

Three connected reliability / performance issues:

1. **No retry/backoff on external APIs.** `DexScreenerClient` and
   `HeliusClient` swallowed errors and returned `[]` / `{}`. A single 429
   or transient 5xx silently became "no data" and the pipeline recorded a
   misleading clean analysis with no warning.
2. **Helius had no rate limiter and opened a fresh `httpx.AsyncClient`
   per call.** Wallet-manipulation, cluster, dev-flow and reverse-discovery
   all hammered Helius with no backpressure. Every call paid the TLS
   handshake cost.
3. **`risk.add_basic_risk_checks` did ~10 sequential `pool.acquire()`
   round-trips per token.** Easy 10× speedup at this layer by batching
   into one transaction with `executemany`.

### What changed

#### `app/http_utils.py` (new)

- `UpstreamUnavailable` exception — raised when retries are exhausted on
  a transient error. Lets callers distinguish "endpoint says no data"
  (e.g. 404 → `httpx.HTTPStatusError`) from "we couldn't reach upstream"
  (→ `UpstreamUnavailable`).
- `is_retryable_http_error()` — predicate for tenacity. Retries on 429,
  any 5xx, timeouts, network errors. Does **not** retry on other 4xx.
- `request_with_retry()` — wraps `httpx.AsyncClient.request()` with
  `tenacity.AsyncRetrying`, exponential backoff with random jitter
  (1s … 30s), max 5 attempts by default.

#### `app/dexscreener.py`

- One persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` is reused across calls (TLS reuse).
- `aclose()` + async context manager protocol added for clean shutdown.
- All HTTP calls go through `_get_json()` → `request_with_retry()`.
- Public methods (`get_latest_profiles`, `get_token_pairs`, …) keep
  back-compatible "log + return empty" behavior on `UpstreamUnavailable`
  so existing service callers continue to skip-and-continue.
- Added strict variants `get_token_pairs_strict()` and
  `get_preferred_token_pair_strict()` that raise `UpstreamUnavailable`.
  These are used by the ingestion pipeline so it can record a
  `data_unavailable` risk_check on persistent failure.

#### `app/helius.py`

- Same shared-client + rate-limit pattern as DexScreener. Configurable via
  `HELIUS_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 0.1).
- All HTTP and JSON-RPC calls now go through `_request()` →
  `request_with_retry()`.
- `aclose()` + async context manager added.
- Public methods now raise `UpstreamUnavailable` on persistent failure
  rather than returning silently empty results. Existing callers already
  catch broad exceptions in their per-item loops so this fails loud where
  before it failed silent.

#### `app/risk.py`

- `add_basic_risk_checks()` now builds a list of validated tuples and
  performs **one** `pool.acquire()` + transaction + `executemany`. Drops
  ~10 round-trips per ingested token to one. The function returns the
  number of rows inserted.
- New `insert_risk_checks(pool, rows)` for general-purpose batch inserts.
- New `record_data_unavailable(...)` helper writes the canonical
  `data_unavailable` risk_check row when an upstream API was reachable-
  but-broken after retries.
- `insert_risk_check()` (single-row + RETURNING) is preserved for the
  occasional caller that needs the inserted row back.

#### `app/ingest_dexscreener.py`

- Uses `get_preferred_token_pair_strict()` for the per-token pair fetch.
- On `UpstreamUnavailable`, upserts a minimal token row and writes one
  `data_unavailable` risk_check before re-raising. Result: when
  DexScreener has a bad day, you get a paper trail instead of an empty
  watchlist row that looks like "we analyzed it and found nothing."
- Closes the shared `DexScreenerClient` in `finally` so the underlying
  `httpx.AsyncClient` is released cleanly.

#### `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`

- Added `tenacity>=9.0.0`.

### Backwards compatibility

- All public method signatures unchanged for DexScreener; new strict
  variants are additive.
- Helius public methods now raise `UpstreamUnavailable` instead of
  silently empty — services already catch broad exceptions per-item.
- `add_basic_risk_checks` previously returned `None`; now returns the
  count of inserted rows. No caller in the codebase reads this return
  value, so this is a non-breaking enrichment.
- `risk_checks` table schema is unchanged.

### Tests

- New `tests/test_http_utils.py`: 12 tests covering the retry predicate
  (429/5xx retried, 4xx not retried, timeouts retried) plus end-to-end
  `request_with_retry()` behavior using a fake `AsyncClient` (succeeds
  on first try, retries 429 then succeeds, retries 503 then succeeds,
  4xx propagates immediately, persistent 429 raises `UpstreamUnavailable`,
  persistent timeout raises `UpstreamUnavailable`).
- New `tests/test_risk_batch.py`: pins the batched-insert behavior with
  a fake pool — asserts `pool.acquire()` is called exactly once and that
  one `executemany` writes all 9 rows. A second test verifies low
  liquidity still emits a `DANGER` row.
- All 52 existing tests still pass (66 total).

### Follow-ups identified during this work (NOT addressed here)

- The shared-instance rate limiter only bounds requests per
  `DexScreenerClient` / `HeliusClient` instance. Several services still
  construct their own client per run, so concurrent runs can collectively
  exceed the upstream rate limit. Promoting the clients to FastAPI
  `lifespan`-managed singletons (next to the asyncpg pool) would close
  this gap.
- The "data unavailable" risk_check is recorded for the DexScreener pair
  fetch in ingest. Helius-driven services (cluster, dev-flow, wallet
  intelligence) still skip-and-continue on `UpstreamUnavailable`. They
  could record their own `data_unavailable` rows to make Helius outages
  equally visible in the dashboard.

## 2026-05-24 — Proper package structure, migration tool, remove dual-import hacks

### Why

Two structural issues made the project fragile:

1. **Fragile imports.** Service files had `try/except ModuleNotFoundError`
   blocks to support two import paths depending on how Python was launched
   (`cwd=app/` for scripts vs project root for tests). This breaks the moment
   a new developer or CI runs from a different directory.

2. **No migration tool.** Migrations were raw SQL applied via `docker cp` +
   PowerShell one-liners. This breaks the moment a teammate joins or you ship
   to a server. There was no way to know which migrations had already been
   applied.

Both are fixed by turning `app/` into a proper installable package with
`pyproject.toml` and adding a lightweight migration runner.

### What changed

#### `pyproject.toml` (new)

- Defines the `memeco` package with setuptools.
- Declares all dependencies (previously in `requirements.txt`).
- Requires Python ≥ 3.10 (the codebase uses `type | None` syntax).
- Console script entry points:
  - `memeco-server` → `app.web_server:main`
  - `memeco-ingest` → `app.ingest_dexscreener:cli`
  - `memeco-pipeline` → `app.run_analysis_pipeline:cli`
  - `memeco-migrate` → `app.apply_migrations:main`

#### `app/__init__.py` (new)

- Marks `app/` as a Python package.

#### `app/apply_migrations.py` (new)

- ~160-line migration runner.
- Creates a `schema_migrations` table (version, filename, SHA-256 checksum,
  applied_at) if not present.
- Discovers all `migrations/*.sql` files, sorts by filename, applies pending
  ones in order.
- Detects TimescaleDB-specific statements (`create_hypertable`,
  `add_retention_policy`, etc.) and runs those outside an explicit transaction.
- Supports `--dry-run` / `-n` to show pending without applying.
- Warns (but doesn't fail) if a previously-applied file's checksum changed.

#### All `app/services/*.py` files with dual imports (10 files)

- Removed every `try: ... except ModuleNotFoundError: ...` block.
- Kept only the canonical `from app.xxx import ...` form.

#### All `app/run_*.py` CLI scripts (17 files)

- Changed `from db import create_pool` → `from app.db import create_pool`.
- Changed `from services.xxx import ...` → `from app.services.xxx import ...`.
- Added `def cli(): asyncio.run(main())` to `run_analysis_pipeline.py` and
  `ingest_dexscreener.py` for the console script entry points.

#### `app/web_server.py`

- Changed all bare imports to absolute `from app.xxx import ...`.

#### `app/ingest_dexscreener.py`

- Changed all bare imports to absolute `from app.xxx import ...`.
- Added `def cli()` entry point.

#### `app/pairs.py`, `app/prices.py`, `app/tokens.py`, `app/risk.py`

- Changed `from validation import require_keys` → `from app.validation import ...`.

#### `app/services/cluster_analysis_service.py`

- Changed bare `from helius import ...` → `from app.helius import ...`.

#### `requirements.txt`

- Kept for backwards compatibility with a note pointing to `pyproject.toml`.
- Changed pinned versions to minimum-version ranges.

#### `README.md`

- Setup section now shows `pip install -e .` + `memeco-migrate`.
- Run sections show console script commands alongside module invocations.
- Kept legacy manual-migration note for existing users.

#### `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`

- Added "Package Structure and Imports" section with rules.
- Added "Migrations" section explaining the runner and how to add new ones.
- Added `pyproject.toml`, `app/__init__.py`, `app/apply_migrations.py` to
  Important Files list.

### Backwards compatibility

- **Tests:** All 52 existing tests pass unchanged — they already used
  `from app.xxx` imports.
- **Running scripts directly:** `python -m app.run_analysis_pipeline` works
  from project root. The old `python app/run_analysis_pipeline.py` from
  `cwd=app/` will NOT work anymore (bare imports removed). Use the console
  scripts or `-m` form instead.
- **Docker:** `docker compose up -d` is unchanged. The migration tool connects
  via `DATABASE_URL` like everything else.
- **CI/CD:** Any CI that did `pip install -r requirements.txt` will still work
  (the file still exists) but should migrate to `pip install -e .`.

### Tests

- `pip install -e .` succeeds cleanly on Python 3.12.
- All imports verified: `from app.db`, `from app.services.*`, `from app.web_server`,
  `from app.apply_migrations` all resolve.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 52 tests, all pass.
- `memeco-migrate --dry-run` correctly discovers 12 migration files in order
  with deterministic checksums.

## 2026-05-24 — Justify the TimescaleDB image: hypertables, retention, continuous aggregate

### Why

`docker-compose.yml` was already pulling `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15`
but no migration ever called `create_hypertable()`. We were paying the image
and operational overhead of TimescaleDB while running it as plain Postgres.
`token_prices` and `raw_api_snapshots` are the two natural candidates: both
are append-mostly, time-keyed, and already grow without bound (`raw_api_snapshots`
in particular has no retention and is queried only by recency).

This was follow-up #4 in the previous changelog entry.

### What changed

#### `migrations/012_timescale_hypertables.sql` (new)

- Loads `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb`.
- Converts `token_prices` to a hypertable on `time` with 1-day chunks. The
  existing `UNIQUE (time, pair_id)` constraint already includes the
  partitioning column, so no schema rewrite is needed.
- Converts `raw_api_snapshots` to a hypertable on `created_at` with 1-day
  chunks. Replaces `PRIMARY KEY (id)` with `PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)`
  because hypertable unique constraints must include the partitioning column.
  The `BIGSERIAL` sequence is unaffected and nothing in the codebase
  references `raw_api_snapshots(id)` by FK, so this is invisible to callers.
- Adds retention policies: `token_prices` keeps 30 days of raw rows,
  `raw_api_snapshots` keeps 14 days. Both are registered with
  `if_not_exists => TRUE`.
- Creates the continuous aggregate `token_prices_hourly` (1-hour buckets per
  pair, OHLC + avg/max liquidity, max 1h/24h volume, last market cap / FDV,
  total buys/sells per hour, sample count) and a refresh policy that runs
  every 30 minutes over the last 30 days. This keeps long-range price
  history available even after the raw rows are dropped by retention.
- The whole migration is idempotent: re-running it emits NOTICEs but does
  not error or duplicate work.

#### `README.md`

- Added migration 012 to the "Apply later migrations in order" block.
- Added a short paragraph explaining what 012 changes and why it justifies
  the TimescaleDB image.

#### `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`

- Added a Performance Rule pointing future contributors at the continuous
  aggregate when they need long-range price history.
- Removed "Add raw snapshot retention policy" from "Known Future Improvements"
  since it is now done.

### Backwards compatibility

- `token_prices` schema is unchanged. The existing upsert in
  `app/prices.py` (`ON CONFLICT (time, pair_id)`) still works because that
  unique constraint already included the partitioning column.
- `raw_api_snapshots` keeps the same columns. The only schema change is
  promoting `(id, created_at)` to the primary key. The insert path in
  `app/system.py` does not specify the primary key columns and is unaffected.
- All existing read paths (`market_filter_service`, `liquidity_filter_service`,
  `web_server.py` lateral joins) are plain SELECTs and continue to work
  against hypertables transparently.
- No application code depends on `raw_api_snapshots(id)` and no FK targets
  it, so dropping/recreating the primary key is safe.
- Retention will start dropping data older than 30 / 14 days. On a fresh
  install nothing is dropped; on an existing install older rows will be
  pruned by the next retention job. If a deployment needs to keep more
  raw history, change the `drop_after` intervals before applying the
  migration.

### Tests

- Validated end-to-end against a real PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB 2.27
  instance:
  - Loaded `001_initial_schema.sql`, inserted 201 sample rows into
    `token_prices` and 51 into `raw_api_snapshots`.
  - Applied `012_timescale_hypertables.sql`. Both tables became hypertables
    with one chunk; all rows preserved; 3 jobs registered (2 retention,
    1 continuous aggregate refresh); `token_prices_hourly` populated
    with 4 hourly buckets.
  - Re-applied the migration: emitted only NOTICEs, no errors, no
    duplicates.
  - Confirmed the existing app SQL paths still work post-migration: the
    `app/prices.py` upsert (`ON CONFLICT (time, pair_id)`) and the
    `app/system.py` snapshot insert both succeeded on the hypertables.

### Follow-ups identified during this work (NOT addressed here)

- Continuous aggregate `token_prices_hourly` is not yet wired into the
  dashboard's 1h/4h/24h price chips. Today those chips read directly from
  `token_prices` via lateral joins. After 30 days of retention they will
  start returning fewer rows; the dashboard should switch to the aggregate
  for any range > a few hours.
- Compression policies were intentionally not added. They are worth doing
  once row volume justifies the operational complexity, especially for
  `raw_api_snapshots` whose JSONB blobs compress very well.

## 2026-05-24 — Migrate web server from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` to FastAPI

### Why

The whole codebase is `asyncio` + `asyncpg`, but the HTTP layer was a hand-rolled
`BaseHTTPRequestHandler` on `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Every request:

- created a brand-new `asyncpg` pool via `create_pool()`,
- ran the handler under `asyncio.run(...)` (new event loop per request),
- closed the pool in a `finally` block.

This wasted TLS handshakes, connection setup, and blocked sync↔async hand-offs.
The migration reuses one pool for the whole process and unlocks streaming JSON,
OpenAPI docs, and proper backpressure.

### What changed

#### `app/web_server.py` (1867 → ~1900 lines, but ~180 lines of hand-rolled HTTP boilerplate removed)

- Replaced `http.server` imports with FastAPI / uvicorn / asyncpg / contextlib.
- Removed `class QuantRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler)` and the
  `ThreadingHTTPServer` entrypoint. Replaced with a `FastAPI` app, route
  decorators, and `uvicorn.run(...)` in `main()`.
- Added a `lifespan` async context manager that creates **one** shared
  `asyncpg.Pool` at app startup and closes it on shutdown
  (`app.state.pool`).
- Refactored every request-scoped helper to take `pool` as its first argument
  instead of creating its own pool:
  - `fetch_summary`, `fetch_watchlist`, `fetch_token_detail`, `fetch_runs`,
    `fetch_whale_radar`, `fetch_wallet_detail`
  - `store_whale_signal`, `store_whale_signal_payload`,
    `maybe_queue_whale_signal_analysis`
  - `run_whale_action`
- Background-thread workers were intentionally **left untouched** because they
  run in a fresh `asyncio.run(...)` loop on a separate thread and must own
  their pool:
  - `run_analysis_pipeline_with_status`
  - `scan_worker`, `manual_token_worker`, `whale_signal_token_worker`
  - `mark_signal_analysis_started`, `mark_signal_analysis_finished`,
    `mark_signal_analysis_failed`
- Added `QuantJSONResponse`, a custom `JSONResponse` that uses
  `json.dumps(..., default=str)` so `Decimal` and `datetime` values serialize
  exactly the way the previous handler did. This keeps existing dashboard
  HTML/JS byte-compatible with the new API.
- Added a `Cache-Control: no-store` middleware to preserve the original
  no-cache header on every response.
- Preserved the original 400-on-bad-input behavior (FastAPI's default 422 was
  bypassed) for:
  - `POST /api/analyze-token` and `POST /api/whale-signal` malformed JSON
    bodies — still return `{"error": "Invalid JSON body"}` with 400.
  - `GET /api/token-detail` non-integer `run_id`/`token_id` — still returns
    `{"error": "run_id and token_id are required integers"}` with 400.
  - `GET /api/wallet-detail` invalid Solana address — still returns
    `{"error": "wallet is required"}` with 400.
- Replaced `parse_limit(query: dict)` with `parse_limit_str(raw: str | None)`
  that takes a single query value and matches the original fallback semantics
  (invalid integer → default).
- Entrypoint is now `python app/web_server.py` (still works) **or** the
  recommended `python -m uvicorn web_server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.
  The `MEMECO_HOST` and `MEMECO_PORT` env vars override defaults when launched
  via `main()`.

| POST   | `/api/whale-radar/{action}`     | `run_whale_action`       |

Where `{action}` ∈ `audit`, `refresh-prices`, `sync-webhook`, `survival`.

#### `requirements.txt`

Pinned all dependencies to current stable versions. Added FastAPI and uvicorn:

```
asyncpg==0.30.0
fastapi==0.115.5
httpx==0.27.2
python-dotenv==1.0.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.1
```

### Backwards compatibility

- All API URLs, query parameters, request bodies, response status codes, and
  response JSON shapes are unchanged.
- All four static HTML pages are still served at the same paths.
- Background scan / manual analyze / whale webhook flows still launch via
  `threading.Thread` exactly as before.
- The webhook `Authorization` check still uses `==` (see Follow-ups). _Resolved in the 2026-05-24 webhook-auth + CI entry below._
- `python app/web_server.py` still works for ad-hoc runs.

### Tests

- No existing test imports `web_server`, so unit tests are unaffected.
- Migration was syntax-checked with `python -m py_compile` and smoke-imported
  to confirm the FastAPI app boots cleanly.

### Follow-ups identified during this work (NOT addressed here)

These are surfaced for future work, intentionally kept out of this change to
limit blast radius:

1. **Constant-time webhook auth.** ~~`/api/whale-signal` compares the
   `Authorization` header with `==`. Should switch to
   `hmac.compare_digest(...)` to remove a timing-attack surface.~~
   Done in `app/web_server.py:_whale_webhook_auth_ok` (2026-05-24).
2. **`docker-compose.yml` magic password.** `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_strong_password`
   is committed verbatim. Should be `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?...}` and live in `.env`.
3. **CLI scripts still create-and-close their own pools** (`run_*.py`,
   `ingest_dexscreener.py`). That is correct for one-shot CLI invocations and
   was deliberately left alone.
4. **TimescaleDB image without hypertables.** ~~No migration calls
   `create_hypertable()` despite using `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15`.
   `token_prices` and `raw_api_snapshots` are the natural candidates.~~
   Done in `migrations/012_timescale_hypertables.sql` (2026-05-24).
5. **Migration tool.** ~~SQL files are still applied via `docker cp` + manual
   `psql`. Adding Alembic / dbmate / a tiny `apply_migrations.py` would make
   onboarding and deploys safer.~~
   Done in `app/apply_migrations.py` + `memeco-migrate` (2026-05-24).
6. **No retry/backoff on DexScreener / Helius.** ~~Transient 429/5xx is silently
   swallowed and recorded as "no data." Add `tenacity` with jitter.~~
   Done in `app/http_utils.py` + `tenacity` retry wiring (2026-05-24).
